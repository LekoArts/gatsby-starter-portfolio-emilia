## About Me

My name is Naoto Nishida.  
I'm currently a Bachelor's student in the College of Media Arts, Science and Technology in the School of Informatics, at [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/).
My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction and System Biology, especially in revealing the learning process of people and suggesting supportive methods to enhance the efficiency of learning.
